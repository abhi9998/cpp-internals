/*
1. Encapsulation -- class provides behaviour with implementation details
    - internal details can be changed without affecting the user
2. Abstraction -- hiding the complexity. represented with class, object, interface, struct, union, enum
3. Inheritance -- hierarchy of classes. Realted thorugh is a relationship. promotes resuability and extensibility 
4. Polymorphism -- many forms. common behavious with different implementaions
    -- compile time are : templates and function overloading
    -- runtime are : function overriding and virtual functions
    used in conjunction with inheritance and composition
